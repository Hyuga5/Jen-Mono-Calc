## Style Guidelines:

- Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of trust and reliability, echoing traditional banking themes.
- Very light blue (#E8EAF6), almost white, provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that helps focus attention on game elements.
- Analogous to the primary, a vibrant purple (#7E57C2) is selected for highlights and active elements to draw attention.
- 'Inter' for a modern, neutral and objective feel, and its suitability for both headlines and body text makes it the perfect choice.
- Use crisp, vector-based icons to represent properties, actions, and game pieces for clarity and scalability.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout that resembles a physical board game to ensure familiarity.
- Incorporate subtle animations for actions such as rolling dice or moving pieces, which will give the game life and add engagement.
